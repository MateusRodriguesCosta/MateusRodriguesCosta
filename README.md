# 👨‍💻 Mateus Costa
**`Feature Craftsman (Engineer/Developer/)`**

I'm a software developer with over six years of experience in IT helping the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I have set sail into Frontend apps and fell in love, Angular is my current favorite playground. Let's talk more and get in touch via "[mateusrocosta][linkedin]".
